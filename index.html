							<h2>Fall 2021: Monday and Wednesday 10-11:50 &#64; CPA201</h2>
							<p>Prerequisites: CSCI 270, CSCI 360 or 467, Python experience</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The course will focus on understanding how AI can be leveraged for social good. It will introduce AI concepts such as data mining, machine learning, decision making and optimization, and fairness in machine learning and algorithmic decision making in the context of informing applications in environmental sustainability (biodiversity, climate, water, forests), disasters and climate change, poverty, homelessness, and health. </p>
							<div>
								Learning Objectives:
								<ol>
									<li>Gain familiarity with a diverse set of AI techniques</li>
									<li>Learn about pressing social good problems and the underlying computational challenges that can inform them</li>
									<li>Become familiar with successful applications of AI techniques to real-world social good problems</li>
									<li>Prototype ML applications in Jupyter Notebook</li>
								</ol>
							</div>
							<p>As part of this course you’ll be teamed up with your peers and asked to ideate a data-driven solution to a social issue. You’ll be coached through developing a full machine learning pipeline which includes data collection/visualization, pre-processing, data modelling, model evaluation, and post-processing. By the end of the semester you’ll be well on your way to publishing a research paper on the topic of your choosing! </p>

							<h2>Current Projects</h2>
							<p>Here are short descriptions of our Fall 2020 class projects</p>

<!-- 						<h4>Definition</h4> -->
 						<dl>
							<dt>TBA</dt>
<!-- 							<dd>
								<p> We are driven by the
									broader goal of developing computational methods for improving educational access, equity, quality,
									and accessibility in society. This project contributes to this broader goal by (1) analyzing financial,
									geographic, and demographic factors that contribute to student and school achievement gaps in California, (2)
									developing ML approaches for predicting student performance in California schools, and (3) using insights from
									ML to develop optimization strategies for allocating school funding to maximize student performance.</p>
							</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>EV Chargers in the City of Los Angeles - Prediction and Optimization</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>We will create a predictive model to determine what factors are most important in determining a
									particular EV charging station’s usage. Then, we will utilize that model in an optimization algorithm to
									find suitable locations where EV charging stations will provide the most use to the Los Angeles
									community.</p>
							</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Project</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The goal of this project is to establish a framework for vaccine distribution by predicting
									neighborhoods in Los Angeles that are at risk. We want to ensure that the vaccine gets in the
									hands of the people it could help the most - front-line medical professionals, first responders, and
									people at high risk. If the vaccine is allocated to sites where it can quickly reach large numbers
									of this priority population, it will reduce the risk of further spread in the neighborhood and allow
									resources to be used in other high risk neighborhoods</p>
							</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>Detecting the Influence of COVID-19 on Social Media Discourse</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Twitter has reported a record increase in its daily user figures during the COVID-19
									pandemic. As a global and free platform for discussion, analyzing and tracking the
									COVID-19 discourse on Twitter can provide public health scientists, economists and policy
									makers insights on the impacts of COVID-19. This project focuses on understanding the influence of COVID-19 which may or may not be
									induced by various economical, social, political and health-related factors.</p>

								<h3>Professor Bistra Dilkina</h3>
								<h4>Instructor</h4>
								<h4>Office hour: Tue 3-4pm &#64; SAL 304</h4>
								<p>The course is taught by Associate Professor Bistra Dilkina, who is also co-director of the USC Center for AI in Society. She has lead extensive research focused on using AI for sustainability and social good, and in particular wildlife conservation. Her work spans both machine learning and discrete optimization algorithms.</p>
