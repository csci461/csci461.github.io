							<dt>Analyzing California K-12 School Performance and Funding</dt>
							<dd>
								<p> We are driven by the
									broader goal of developing computational methods for improving educational access, equity, quality,
									and accessibility in society. This project contributes to this broader goal by (1) analyzing financial,
									geographic, and demographic factors that contribute to student and school achievement gaps in California, (2)
									developing ML approaches for predicting student performance in California schools, and (3) using insights from
									ML to develop optimization strategies for allocating school funding to maximize student performance.</p>

							<dt>EV Chargers in the City of Los Angeles - Prediction and Optimization</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>We will create a predictive model to determine what factors are most important in determining a
									particular EV charging stationâ€™s usage. Then, we will utilize that model in an optimization algorithm to
									find suitable locations where EV charging stations will provide the most use to the Los Angeles
									community.</p>
							</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Project</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The goal of this project is to establish a framework for vaccine distribution by predicting
									neighborhoods in Los Angeles that are at risk. We want to ensure that the vaccine gets in the
									hands of the people it could help the most - front-line medical professionals, first responders, and
									people at high risk. If the vaccine is allocated to sites where it can quickly reach large numbers
									of this priority population, it will reduce the risk of further spread in the neighborhood and allow
									resources to be used in other high risk neighborhoods</p>
							</dd>
							<br>
							<dt>Detecting the Influence of COVID-19 on Social Media Discourse</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Twitter has reported a record increase in its daily user figures during the COVID-19
									pandemic. As a global and free platform for discussion, analyzing and tracking the
									COVID-19 discourse on Twitter can provide public health scientists, economists and policy
									makers insights on the impacts of COVID-19. This project focuses on understanding the influence of COVID-19 which may or may not be
									induced by various economical, social, political and health-related factors.</p>
