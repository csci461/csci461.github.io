							<dt>Time-to-relapse predictions for alcohol use disorder patients</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Much of the research in the addiction sciences field is centered around opioid use or substance use disorder (SUD) in general. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) which is the most prevalent substance use disorder worldwide is less commonly studied and even less so in the context of the intersection between social work and computer science. In this paper, we use a longitudinal cohort of (n = 3290) individuals across a 12 month treatment study specific to AUD to identify homogeneous subgroups within the heterogeneous population and determine how these subgroups differ with respect to relapse events. To do this we use clustering analysis to determine the unique characteristics of patients undergoing AUD treatment and survival modeling to determine patients’ time to relapse and predictors which contribute significantly to it. Based on these results, we can better understand the factors that affect patient relapse within each individual subgroup to inform better treatment programs tailored to individuals in a given subgroup.</p>

							<dt>Towards Precise Detection of Toxic Pharmaceutical Drugs using Vision Transformers</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>As modern health research continues to produce more complex pharmacological treatments, the public receives an ever-growing list of prospective tablets that can aid in treating various ailments and symptoms. While there are several benefits to these medical advancements, it is critical to realize the hazards associated with medications and their chemical combinations, one of them being the risk of medication errors by patients. This work employs Vision Transformer, a deeplearning model for determining medications. It employs fast data-preprocessing, data-augmentation techniques, and attention mechanisms to reliably recognize the kind of medicine given a picture of a pill. Furthermore, the model is built using a real-world dataset and evaluated using multiple quality metrics.</p>

							<dt>Leveraging Machine Learning to predict Diabetes in Republic of Mali and Republic of Benin</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for medical diagnosis is a growing sub field. ML is driving the data driven model data revolution to help medical providers diagnose diseases. Prior work, in the diabetes domain has focused on ML models working on impoverished data set. These data sets mostly deal with healthcare variables and have at most 10-20 features. This current ML pipeline aims to model a comprehensive Diabetes ML model accounting for Co-morbid conditions, Food habits, Addiction history, Socio-demographic features and Living conditions. This ML pipeline model aims to build a ML model to aid medical healthcare providers in Sub-Saharan African nations. The current case study focuses on Sub-Saharan African nations of Republic of Mali and Republic of Benin.</p>

							<dt>Relationship between crimes and socio-economic factors in Los Angeles</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>In recent times there has been a motive among researchers to study the issues related to different types of crime and socioeconomic factors across the United States and to understand the relationship between the several underlying intricacies. Over the past decade, the crime rate has increased by over 30% in the greater Los Angeles area and it continues to increase at an unprecedented rate. It is paramount to identify the underlying causes and preconditions of crime which plays a crucial role in the process of crime reduction and prevention. With the advancement of technology in recent years, getting access to crime and census data has become relatively less challenging and it paves the way to predict population-based data at a microscopic level. The sole aim of this research is to identify the correlation between several socio-economic factors (Ex: Unemployment, poverty, educational background, mean income, etc.) of the population and corresponding crime occurrences in the city of Los Angeles. In addition to this, the experiment also aims to identify the hotspots of crime and evaluate the major contributing factors to such crimes.</p>

<dt>Predicting PM2.5 Concentration in the Aftermath of a Wildfire</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Wildfires are becoming increasingly common in the United States and are being further exacerbated by the effects of climate change such as severe drought and extreme heat. Particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers is the main pollutant emitted from wildfire smoke. PM2.5 poses significant health risks to humans. Typically, public caution regarding wildfires focuses on avoiding active wildfires and offers far fewer warnings about the resulting pollutants in their aftermath, despite a provable danger to humans. PM2.5 is typically measured using air quality monitors which can offer valuable information about the concentration of dangerous pollutants in specific localities. Unfortunately, these air quality monitors are few and far between. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict the level of PM2.5 at the epicenter of a wildfire, a week after it has been contained. Our predictions will be based solely on the wildfire characteristics and land usage patterns at the site of the fire. We strongly believe that such PM2.5 predictions will benefit communities impacted by wildfires by helping them make informed decisions on when it is safe to venture out in the absence of actual PM2.5 monitors.</p>

<dt>A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Prevalence
of Type-2 Diabetes and Asthma in California state</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Asthma and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are significant public health concerns that cause substantial amounts of potentially avoidable spending on healthcare. For years, many cases of T2DM and asthma go undiagnosed, which increases healthcare expenses and produces less favorable results. T2DM and asthma are frequently undertreated as well, which results in ineffective disease management and increased costs. The social determinants of health (SDoH), which include factors in the environments in which we are born, grow, live, work, and age, are also known to affect diabetes and asthma. This paper focuses on predicting and mapping the prevalence of Diabetes and Asthma based on census tract-level data for the state of California. The rate of prevalence for both diseases can be thought of as a measure of the susceptibility to underdiagnosis for the people residing in that particular tract. Predictions were visualized on a California census tract map and compared against the true values. The underlying feature importance was used to gain deeper insights into understanding the prevalence of diabetes and asthma in a particular census tract.</p>

<dt>Vaccine Detection - Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines based on Behavioral and Socioeconomic Factors by Geographic Regions across the US, Key Factors, and Correlation Analysis</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Following the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our day to day lives, society was once again reminded of the necessity of vaccines and how they are perceived varyingly by different people. Today, it is undeniable that the quick development of vaccines as well as the public’s readiness and education on these vaccines helped life return to normal within a few years. Therefore, this paper explores and analyzes how various behavioral and socioeconomic factors have influenced the public in receiving past vaccines to the seasonal flu as well as H1N1 (swine flu) to better understand certain motivations and responses to vaccines in the past and going forward especially across geographic regions in the United States. Based on this analysis, we aim to utilize ML strategies to predict either vaccine’s administration likelihood independently, codependently, and in conjunction with each other based on selected features. Ultimately, visualize the proportion of residents predicted to take the vaccine over 10 regions across the US. This would ideally help us optimize vaccine accessibility and administration per region based on making recommendations on which factors to allocate funding for and aid overall vaccine education. This report hence provides current progress on this project and highlights future tasks needed to accomplish our goal.

<dt>Predicting Foster Care Outcomes in the United States with the National Youth in Transition Database</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) hosts one of the largest sources of information on youth aging out of the foster care system in the United States. It covers nearly 10 years and consists of basic demographic information coupled with outcome data and independent living service (ILS) utilization for thousands of individuals. While past work has identified ILS as an impactful measure on positive adult outcomes in foster youth, other work has shown that utilization of these services varies based on demographics and location. This project aims to identify to what extent independent living services influence youth outcomes with respect to demographic data. In this report, we will focus on substance abuse referrals to analyze indicators for high-risk behavior in youth who may lack adequate support systems. Out of our five classification models, we determine the random forest classifier has the highest performance for substance abuse referral prediction and maintains fairness across genders, races, and geographic regions. After feature selection, our random forest classifier achieves significant improvements in the run time and most scoring metrics. Across all five models, we identified that having a connection to an adult and current school enrollment increases the likelihood of substance abuse referral. On the other hand, educational aid, public food assistance, and other public financial assistance may deter referral, meaning youth who receive these forms of aid may have lower rates of substance abuse.</p>

							<dt>EV Chargers in the City of Los Angeles - Prediction and Optimization</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>We will create a predictive model to determine what factors are most important in determining a
									particular EV charging station’s usage. Then, we will utilize that model in an optimization algorithm to
									find suitable locations where EV charging stations will provide the most use to the Los Angeles
									community.</p>

							<dt>COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Project</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The goal of this project is to establish a framework for vaccine distribution by predicting
									neighborhoods in Los Angeles that are at risk. We want to ensure that the vaccine gets in the
									hands of the people it could help the most - front-line medical professionals, first responders, and
									people at high risk. If the vaccine is allocated to sites where it can quickly reach large numbers
									of this priority population, it will reduce the risk of further spread in the neighborhood and allow
									resources to be used in other high risk neighborhoods</p>
